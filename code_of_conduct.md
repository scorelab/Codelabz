## Best Contribution Practices

**Commits**

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (More info at https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests )
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. This makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

**Feature Requests and Bug Reports**

- When you file a feature request or when you are submitting a bug report, make sure you add steps to reproduce it. Especially if that bug is some weird/rare one.
