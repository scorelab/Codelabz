# FAQs

### 1. Do I need to purchase Blaze plan to run the app ?
### Answer -
 No, you don't need to purchase Blaze plan to run the app. You need to purchase it only if you want to deploy firebase cloud functions.
<hr/>

### Solution :-
This problem generally arises when you have not setuped/started the Firebase emulators.

1. [Setup firebase emulator](#install-configure-and-integrate-firebase-emulator-suite). 
2. [Start the Emulators](#to-start-the-emulators-)
3. Run the app using `npm run dev`.

>üìù**NOTE** : Remember to start the emulators before running the app. 

- To start emulators - `firebase emulators:start --import=firebase.json --project <your-project-id>`. <br/>
- In some case all the emulator will not start. So you can execute a separate command for a particular emulator<br/>
  For example if auth emulator is not starting you can use this command - <br/> `firebase emulators:start --import=firebase.json --project <your-project-id> --only auth`.
<hr/>

### 4. I am creating new account and it says that confirmation mail is sent to my email but I didn't got any mail.

### Answer :-
This feature is not implemented completely and we are currently working on this. If you still want to login/signup, you can try login/signup with google option.
<hr/>

### 5. I have done the environment setup, but when I start the app it is showing white/blank screen.

### Solution :-
This problem can arise in multiple scenarios :-
1. Check the browser console and see what error are you getting there and try to fix it.
2. Make sure that you have created `.env` file and placed all values to the keys.
3. In some cases it can also arise due to any active ad-blocker extension in your browser. So make sure to turn it off.

### 7. I want to contribute but don't know where to start.

### Answer :-

2. Have a look into issues that are already raised and are not assigned to anyone and ask the mentors to get it assigned it to you.
